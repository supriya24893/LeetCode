There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row can be a post or comment on the post.
parent_id is null for posts.
parent_id for comments is sub_id for another post in the table.
 

Write an SQL query to find the number of comments per post. The result table should contain post_id and its corresponding number_of_comments.

The Submissions table may contain duplicate comments. You should count the number of unique comments per post.

The Submissions table may contain duplicate posts. You should treat them as one post.

The result table should be ordered by post_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 
WITH tb1 AS(
select DISTINCT sub_id 
from Submissions
where parent_id is NULL),

tb2 as
(select  a.sub_id, b.sub_id as comments
from tb1 as a
left join Submissions as b
on a.sub_id=b.parent_id)

select sub_id as post_id, count(distinct comments) as number_of_comments
from tb2
group by sub_id
