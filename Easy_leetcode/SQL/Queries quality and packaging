+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |

There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write an SQL query to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.


with cte_01 as
(
select
	q.query_name
	,sum(q.rating *1.0 / q.position) as query_qual
	,sum(case when q.rating < 3 then 1.00 else 0.00 end) as poor_qual
	,COUNT(*) * 1.0 as query_cnt
from Queries as q
group by
	q.query_name
)
select
	c1.query_name
	,round(c1.query_qual / c1.query_cnt,2) as quality
	,round(c1.poor_qual / c1.query_cnt * 100,2) as poor_query_percentage
from cte_01 as c1;
