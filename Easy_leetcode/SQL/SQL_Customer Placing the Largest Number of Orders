Table: Orders

+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
 

Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The query result format is in the following example.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select customer_number
from
(SELECT customer_number, count(distinct order_number) as total_o
FROM Orders
group by customer_number) as t1
order by total_o desc
limit 1
