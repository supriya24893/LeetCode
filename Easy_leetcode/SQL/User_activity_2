There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website. 
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
 

Write an SQL query to find the average number of sessions per user for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively, rounded to 2 decimal places. The sessions we want to count for a user are those with at least one activity in that time period.

The query result format is in the following example.


select ISNULL(ROUND(AVG(1.00*session_count),2), 0) as average_sessions_per_user
from
(select user_id, count(distinct session_id) as session_count
from
(select *
from Activity
where activity_date>'2019-06-27' and activity_date<='2019-07-27') tab1
group by user_id) as tab2
