Table: Subscriptions

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| start_date  | date |
| end_date    | date |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the start and end dates of an account's subscription.
Note that always start_date < end_date.
 

Table: Streams

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| session_id  | int  |
| account_id  | int  |
| stream_date | date |
+-------------+------+
session_id is the primary key column for this table.
account_id is a foreign key from the Subscriptions table.
Each row of this table contains information about the account and the date associated with a stream session.
 

Write an SQL query to report the number of accounts that bought a subscription in 2021 but did not have any stream session.

The query result format is in the following example.


select count (distinct account_id) as accounts_count
from
(select s1.account_id, s1.start_date, s2.session_id,s2.stream_date
from Subscriptions as s1 
left join 
Streams as s2
on s1.account_id=s2.account_id and YEAR(s1.start_date)<=2021 and YEAR(s1.end_date)>=2021) as t2
where YEAR(stream_date)<>2021
