select sum(total_app) as apple_count, sum(total_oranges) as orange_count
from
(select b_apple_count+c_apple_count as total_app, b_orange_count+c_orange_count as total_oranges
from
(select b.box_id,b.chest_id,b.apple_count as b_apple_count,b.orange_count as b_orange_count, isnull(c.apple_count,0) as c_apple_count, isnull(c.orange_count,0) as c_orange_count  from Boxes as b 
left join
Chests as c
on b.chest_id=c.chest_id) as t1) as t2
