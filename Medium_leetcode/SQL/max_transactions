Each row contains information about one transaction.
 

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the transactions with the maximum amount on their respective day. If in one day there are multiple such transactions, return all of them.

Return the result table ordered by transaction_id in ascending order.



select transaction_id
from
(select *, rank() over (partition by date_only order by amount desc) as amt_rank
from
(SELECT transaction_id, CAST(DAY AS DATE) as date_only, amount
from Transactions) as t1) as t2
where amt_rank=1
order by transaction_id
