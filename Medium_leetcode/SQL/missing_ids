Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
 

Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.

Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.

Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.


WITH rank_cte as
(select min(customer_id) as  min_range, max(customer_id) as max_range
from Customers),

tab2 as (select 1 as ids
          union all
          select ids+1 as ids
          from tab2
          where ids<(select max_range from rank_cte)
         )

select ids from tab2
where ids not in (select customer_id from Customers)
