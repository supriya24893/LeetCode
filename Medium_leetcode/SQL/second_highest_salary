Table: Employee

| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.

The query result format is in the following example.

 with shs as  (
    select distinct salary as SecondHighestSalary from
    (select salary, dense_rank() over (order by salary desc) as rnk from employee) x
    where rnk=2
),
cnt as (
select count(SecondHighestSalary) as cnt from shs
)
select case when cnt=0 then null when cnt>=1 then (select SecondHighestSalary from shs) end as SecondHighestSalary from cnt
