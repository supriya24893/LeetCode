id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

select a.id from
(select c.*,
lag(c.temperature) over(order by c.recordDate asc) as 't_previous_day',
lag(c.recordDate) over(order by c.recordDate asc) as 'date_previous_day'
from Weather c
) a
where a.t_previous_day < a.temperature and DATEDIFF(a.recordDate, a.date_previous_day)=1;
